program description: This is a puzzle that has 9 scrambled pieces. Click on one and drag while the mouse is held down to move a piece onto the board on the 
left. If you move the piece close enough to the right spot, it will lock in and the board piece will become visible, showing your progress. When you complete 
the puzzle, you can either drag the whole thing around or click on the puzzle tostart over and play again.

1. In command mode, $ to move cursor to the end of the current line and 0 to 
move curson to the beginning of the current line.
2. To highlight the current line, :set cursorline
3. Static means that a variable can be accessed without requiring an 
instantiation of the class to which it belongs.
4. It means you can call the method without creating the object to which it 
belongs. example
class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    static();  //calling without object
    Example t = new Example(); //Or else nonstatic wont run
    t.nonstatic();  //calling using object
  } 
  static void static() {
    System.out.println("Programming is amazing.");
  }
  void nonstatic(){
    System.out.println("Java is awesome.");
  }
}
5. Override means overriding the functionionality of an existing method. For 
example I overrided the equals() method of BoardPiece by casting o as a 
PuzzlePiece object.
6. cut -c 5-13 foo
