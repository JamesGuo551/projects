Program description:
Parallelograms: You must enter a number from 2 to 20 to indicate what size
parallelograms you want drawn. The program will then draw those parallelograms
made out of *. I tested my program by entering numbers and it was tested well.
FlippingBlockH: You start the program by clicking on the canvas to make the
Hblock appear. You can then drag it around, making the block turn colorful.
If you hold on the right bar, the block will flip right, and vice versa for 
left. If you hold down on the center bar, the block and canvas will have 
inverted colors. You can move the mouse off the screen to reset everything 
and move it back on for instructions to appear again and start over. I tested
the code by trying every function and every function worked well without 
glitches.
