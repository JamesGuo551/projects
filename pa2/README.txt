will be a single message consisting of the smallest positive number that was 
entered. If all negative numbers were entered, then a single message with
the largest negative number in it will be printed. If a mix of both 
negative and positive numbers were entered, then the message will say the
largest negative number entered and the smallest positive number entered. If
no numbers were entered, the output will say that no numbers were entered.

For the DraggingBlockH program the user can do many cool things. When they
click on the screen, the instructions will disappear and an "H block" will
be created centered where the mouse was clicked. The user can then press on 
the block and drag it around. While the block is being dragged around, it 
will change colors and move where the mouse is being moved. As soon as the
mouse is released, the block returns to black until the user presses on the
block to drag it again. If the mouse moves off the canvas, the block 
disappears and the screen will be blank. As soon as the mouse reenters the
canvas, the instructions will appear again and the user can click to restart
the whole process.
