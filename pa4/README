Description: My program starts with a blank canvas that has only an x and y
axis on it. You can press on the lines to drag and move them around. You can
also click anywhere to make a sphere that will then continuously shrink and
grow. If you move the lines around at this point, they will change the color
of the sphere depending on how the quadrants are reshaped. Quadrant 1 has
magenta spheres, quadrant 2 has cyan spheres, quadrant 3 has yellow spheres,
quadrant 4 has black spheres.

1. I worked alone and asked any questions I had on piazza so there was no
opportunity to cheat.
2. cp ../../../../zumba.java .
3. man diff pulls up the manual and describes what the diff command does in
detail
4. rm -rf $HOME/*.jar
5. q! will quit with no warning while q will quit with a warning if a modified
file has not been saved.
6. gg will go to the first line to the first non blank character
7. Method overloading is allowing a class to have multiple methods with the
same name if their number of parameters or data type of paramaters or sequence
of data type of parameters differs.
