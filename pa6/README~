Description: My program lets you make cosmic spheres and control them. When
you start the
them do this activity again. Clear all will remove all the spheres from the
board. The spheres change colors depending on which quadrant you're in and you
can control these quadrans by moving lines. Everything stays in the same
location proportionate to the canvas size if you resize it.
