Description: My program lets you make cosmic spheres and control them. When
you start the
them do this activity again. Clear all will remove all the spheres from the
board. The spheres change colors depending on which quadrant you're in and you
can control these quadrans by moving lines. Everything stays in the same
location proportionate to the canvas size if you resize it.

1. vi +LineNumber fileName
2. :syntax off and :syntax on while in command mode
3. :help user-manual
4. typing ":help word" then hit control-D to see matching help entries for
"word"
5. The call stack
6. An interface declaration consists of modifiers, the keyword interface, the 
interface name, a comma-separated list of parent interfaces (if any), and the 
interface body. Modifer can be public or private and suchbut it's usually
public since classes implement interfaces.
7. If professional engineers cheat, then there are very serious legal
implications such as copyright lawsuits. Also, in a theoretical world, if
every engineer copies off of each other, then no work is produced and it's
simply the copying of nothing so engineering is basically pointless.
