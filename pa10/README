1. I looked up how to use the object draw library and also how inheritance and
polymorphism works. This maintained my integrity because I did not look up any
specific answers. I just looked up explanations for how stuff works. Any 
answers or ideas were of my own.
2. You can use == to check if two objects reference the same thing. 
line1 == line2 returns false for deep copy and true for shallow copy. I then
check if line1.equals(line2) returns true because if they are copies they will
have the same content.
3. A deep comparison would call equals on instance fields of the objects being 
compared. I would do .equals for the name, point1, and point2 of each of the
two lines.
