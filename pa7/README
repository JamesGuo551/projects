Description: My palindrome program takes in some text file to run. This is
done in the command line by putting java PA7indrome "text file name" The
program then goes through the text file and checks if it is a palindrome or
not. Afterwards, it will print out whether or not the file is a palindrome.
My spin wheel program opens up two wheels on a canvas and then you can click
buttons to play a game. Click the spin player one button to start player one's
turn. If you go over 100 points, then it becomes player two's turn. Player
two does the same. Either player can also press their finish turn button to
end their turn prematurely. After player two is finished, whoever is closest
to 100 points will win. If both players are over 100 points, then it is a tie.
Points are added when the red cursor lands on an image after the wheel stops
spinning. The number it lands on is how many points you get. You can always
press restart to start the game over.
