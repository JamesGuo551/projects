# spis16-webapps-oauth-github-org-example 

Running on heroku at: http://drawing-app-lj.herokuapp.com/
This is a project I made with my partner at a summer program. We got help with the login and saving work but coded everything for
the app itself, including the GUI. I can't find the original code files for this but right click on the drawing app and click view source
to see everything that my partner and I coded. It's in a variety of languages.


Requires:

```
pip install --user Flask-OAuthlib
pip install --user PyGithub
```

The `--user` is only for ACMS accounts: leave off the `--user` if running on your own PC.
